<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi! 
My name is Barbara. I am 35 years old, Ella's (2) mother and Adiel's wife. 
My whole story will take too many pages so I will save the long version for when we meet in person. 
For now, I will tell you how I ended up writing here, on my own webpage.

I live in Israel and On October 7th 2023 the we were attacked by the world known terror organisation, HAMAS - DA'ISH.
We are at war, and it changed the life of most Israeli civilians, including me.

Most of my life I worked in the restaurant industry. This last 6 years I have been working in a group of top chef's restaurant as a senior manager in different roles.
Since the war started, all the industry was shuted down for weeks. 
A lot of businesses are closing permanently, and people are loosing their jobs. Now, It will take years for the industry to recover.

Studying web development is a good start to entre this high-tech world, I believe in learning everything from base to be the best at what you do, even if I ame the managing world. 
and so i did. Now i welcome you to check out my work and progress in that little time I had to learn until now. I feel comfrotable in my current sit and i feel that the sky might not even be a limit :)
