<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Barbara and i'm 35 years old. I'm Ella's (2) mother and Adiel's wife. 
  My story is pretty long so i will save the long version when we meet in person. 
  For now i will tell you how i ended up writing here, on my own webpage.</p>

<p>I live in Israel and a few weeks ago we were attacked by the world knowen terror organisation, HAMAS - DA'ISH.<br>
  We are at war and it changed the life of most of the israeli civiliens, me included.</p>
  <p>
  Almost all my life i worked in the restaurant industry. This last 6 years i have been workin in a group of highclassed chef's restaurant as a signor manager in diffrent roles.
  On the October 7th 2023 the war started and all the industry was shut down for weeks. 
  A lot of buisnesses closed permantly and people lost their jobs. It will take years for the industrey to recover espacially that the Corona virus story was not long ago.
  I had to act quickly and i have decided to chang my career and study webdev, a thought i once had not long ago in corona times. 
</p>
<p>
  In desprate time one should make life changing decisions in order to surviv,
  and so i did. Now i welcome you to check out my work and progress in that little time i had to lurn until now. i feel comfrotable in my current sit and i feel the the sky might not even be a limit :)
  </p>
